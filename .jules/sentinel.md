## 2026-02-10 - Sensitive Configuration Exposure via RLS
**Vulnerability:** Broad RLS policies on the `settings` table allowed any staff member to view all settings, including sensitive API keys (`api_keys`) and payment gateway secrets (`payment_gateways`).
**Learning:** In projects using a single key-value `settings` table, a generic "Staff can view" policy creates a significant risk if sensitive integration secrets are stored alongside UI configuration.
**Prevention:** Implement granular RLS policies that explicitly exclude sensitive keys from general staff access, or separate secrets into a dedicated, admin-only table.
